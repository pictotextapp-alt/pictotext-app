Critical Missing Features to Implement:

Content-Aware Background Reconstruction:

Use inpainting algorithms (like OpenCV's inpaint function) to fill text areas with contextually appropriate background
Don't just place solid colors - reconstruct what the background likely looked like


Smart Text Removal Pipeline:
Step 1: OCR detects text + bounding boxes
Step 2: Create mask of text regions
Step 3: Apply content-aware fill/inpainting to remove text cleanly
Step 4: Place new text with matching font properties

Font Analysis and Matching:

Analyze original text properties (size, color, font weight, spacing)
Match replacement text styling to original as closely as possible
Use font detection libraries or provide manual font selection


Advanced OCR Configuration:

Use EasyOCR or PaddleOCR instead of basic Tesseract for better accuracy
Get precise character-level bounding boxes, not just word-level
Detect text orientation and skew


Background Reconstruction Techniques:
python# Example approach
import cv2

# Create mask from text regions
mask = create_text_mask(text_boxes)

# Apply inpainting to reconstruct background
reconstructed = cv2.inpaint(image, mask, inpaintRadius=3, flags=cv2.INPAINT_TELEA)

# Add new text with proper styling
final_image = add_styled_text(reconstructed, new_text, font_properties)


Libraries to Use:

OpenCV for advanced image processing and inpainting
EasyOCR or PaddleOCR for better text detection
PIL/Pillow with custom font rendering
scikit-image for advanced image restoration

The Real Challenge:
The hardest part isn't OCR - it's cleanly removing text while preserving/reconstructing the underlying background. This requires sophisticated image inpainting algorithms, not just rectangular overlays.
Expected Workflow:

Upload image → 2. Detect text with precise bounds → 3. User selects text to replace → 4. Intelligently remove original text → 5. Reconstruct background → 6. Insert new text with matched styling → 7. Output seamless result

Focus on implementing proper background reconstruction - that's what will make this tool actually usable like Canva's feature.
