Current Problem: The inpainting is creating blurry, distorted results instead of clean background reconstruction.
Specific Technical Requirements:

Use Better Inpainting Libraries:

python# DON'T use basic cv2.inpaint() - it creates blur like your result
# USE these instead:

# Option 1: LaMa (Best quality)
from lama_cleaner import LaMaInpainting

# Option 2: Use edge-aware inpainting
import cv2
result = cv2.inpaint(img, mask, 3, cv2.INPAINT_NS)  # Use NS method, not TELEA

# Option 3: Use segmentation-based approach
from skimage.segmentation import random_walker

Create Precise Text Masks:

python# Current mask is probably too large/imprecise
# Use character-level detection instead of word-level
import easyocr
reader = easyocr.Reader(['en'])
results = reader.readtext(image, paragraph=False)  # Get individual characters

Multi-Step Process:

pythondef process_image(image, old_text, new_text):
    # Step 1: Create tight mask around ONLY the text characters
    precise_mask = create_character_level_mask(image, old_text)
    
    # Step 2: Use edge-preserving inpainting
    clean_bg = advanced_inpainting(image, precise_mask)
    
    # Step 3: Add new text with exact font matching
    final_image = add_text_with_style_matching(clean_bg, new_text, original_text_style)
    
    return final_image

Alternative Approach - Use AI Models:

python# If OpenCV inpainting fails, use these:
# - Use Stable Diffusion inpainting models
# - Use RunwayML or similar API for professional inpainting
# - Use GFPGAN or similar restoration models
Quick Test to Debug:

First, show me JUST the mask you're creating (save mask as separate image)
Show me JUST the inpainting result (before adding new text)
Then show final result with new text added

Alternative Simple Approach:
If inpainting keeps failing, try this simpler method:
python# Instead of inpainting, try:
1. Detect text area
2. Sample colors from immediate surrounding pixels  
3. Use those colors to create gradient fill
4. Add new text on top
Libraries to Install:
bashpip install lama-cleaner
pip install easyocr  
pip install opencv-python
pip install pillow
pip install scikit-image
Expected Output: Clean background reconstruction with new text that matches original styling perfectly.
Debug Question: Can you show me the intermediate steps - the mask image and the inpainting-only result before text is added?
