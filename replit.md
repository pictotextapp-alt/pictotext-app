# PictoText

## Overview

PictoText is a professional web application for extracting and manipulating text from images using advanced OCR technology. The application uses advanced OCR technology with content-aware inpainting to cleanly remove text from backgrounds, then presents the text as editable DOM elements that can be moved, styled, and customized independently. It features line-based text detection, soft mask generation, and sophisticated inpainting algorithms for professional-quality results.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The frontend is built as a React Single Page Application (SPA) using TypeScript and modern React patterns:
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript for type safety
- **Project Structure**: Frontend code organized in `/src` directory for Cloudflare Pages compatibility
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management and caching
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui component system
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS custom properties for theming
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **Static Assets**: `/public` directory containing HTML entry point and static resources

### Backend Architecture
The backend follows an Express.js RESTful API architecture:
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Schema Management**: Drizzle Kit for database migrations and schema management
- **Storage Interface**: Abstracted storage layer with in-memory implementation (easily extensible to database)

- **Anonymous Tracking**: Session-based usage tracking for non-authenticated users using `anon_${sessionId}` prefix

### Authentication & Authorization
The application supports multiple authentication methods:
- **Anonymous Usage**: Free tier (3 images/day) requires no authentication, tracked by session ID
- **Email Registration**: Traditional username/password authentication with bcrypt hashing
- **Google OAuth**: One-click Google sign-in using passport-google-oauth20 strategy
- **User Management**: Extended user schema supporting both local and OAuth accounts
